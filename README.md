ETEC Final Web Project README

Project Overview
This project, hosted at https://phang-viphath.github.io/final-web-5-12, is a web application developed as a final assignment during my studies at ETEC (Engineering and Technology Education Center). It demonstrates my web development skills, leveraging HTML, Bootstrap, and Tailwind CSS to create a responsive, modern, and visually appealing website.

Purpose
The purpose of this project is to showcase my ability to:
Structure web content using HTML
Utilize Bootstrap for pre-built components and responsive design
Apply Tailwind CSS for custom, utility-first styling
Combine frameworks effectively for a polished user experience
Deploy a website using GitHub Pages

Features
Responsive Design: Adapts seamlessly to desktop, tablet, and mobile screens using Bootstrap's grid system and Tailwind's responsive utilities.
Bootstrap Components: Includes navigation bars, buttons, cards, and more for rapid development.
Tailwind Styling: Custom styles for typography, spacing, and colors with a utility-first approach.
Modern UI: Clean, consistent design with hover effects and smooth layouts.
(Add more features specific to your project, e.g., forms, modals, etc.)

Technologies Used
HTML: For structuring the content.
Bootstrap: For responsive components and grid system (via CDN).
Tailwind CSS: For flexible, custom styling (via CDN).
JavaScript (if applicable): For interactivity, enhanced by Bootstrap's JS components.
GitHub Pages: For hosting the live site.
